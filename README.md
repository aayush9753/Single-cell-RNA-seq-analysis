# Single Cell RNAseq Analysis of Tabula Muris Data
I have made all the notebooks using Kaggle kernel and they can also be viewed there.

### Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/aayush9753/singlecell-rnaseq-data-from-mouse-brain
### 1. Theory - Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq - [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/aayush9753/theory-introduction-to-single-cell-rna-seq?scriptVersionId=74733387) 
- Covers most of the theoretical concepts about Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and Computational Analysis.
### 2. AnnData and Preprocessing spike-ins - [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/aayush9753/1-anndata-and-preprocessing-spike-ins) 
- Theory behind AnnData objects
- Exploring a test anndata
- Creating Anndata from the csv files in the dataset
- Preprocessing the labeling spike-ins
### 3. Quality Control in Single cell RNA-seq data - [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/aayush9753/2-quality-control-in-single-cell-rna-seq-data) 
- Calculated the quality control metrices across cells and genes.
- Quality control in cells by removing cells with less total gene count, less unique genes and giving more spike-ins.
- Quality control in genes by removing genes which occur in less unique cells as well as those genes having less total cells.
- Saving the quality controlled data for further pipeline.
### 4. Theory - Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq - [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/aayush9753/theory-introduction-to-single-cell-rna-seq?scriptVersionId=74733387) 
- Covers most of the theoretical concepts about Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and Computational Analysis.
